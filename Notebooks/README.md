# Hands-on Labs

These labs will be executed using a virtual machine that runs a Linux Ubuntu 16.0.4 OS and has pre-installed the following software packages:

1. Java Open JDK 1.8
2. Apache Spark 2.2.0 (including Hadoop 2.6)
3. Anaconda Python 3.6
4. Apache Zepellin 0.7.3 (TBD)

Jupyter Notebooks will be used as the default tool for the hands-on sessions. We may occassionally use Apache Zeppelin as a demonstrator of it's capabilities.

## Setup steps

Login to the virtual machine and start-up a PySpark application with Jupyter Notebook as the driver program: 

```
1. cd spark-course
2. vagrant ssh
3. start_notebook.sh
```

The later start-up a Jupyter notebook as the driver program of your spark application. The notebook is started up showing the contents of the Labs directory , just select the corresponding directory and notebook.
